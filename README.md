## Environmental Variables/Files

We have environment variables setup for Authentication. The tutorial can be found here: https://medium.com/craft-academy/encrypted-credentials-in-ruby-on-rails-9db1f36d8570

The tutorial above will help you understand now we encrypted the admin page's username and password!


## Deployment

Setup a Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/

From the heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipline`

Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repo to the pipline

Our application does not need any extra options, so select `Enable Review Apps` right away

Click `New app` under review apps, and link your test branch from your repo

Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link your main branch from your repo

--------

To add enviornment variables to enable google oauth2 functionality, head over to the settings tab on the pipeline dashboard

Scroll down until `Reveal config vars`

Add both your client id and your secret id, with fields `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively

Now once your pipeline has built the apps, select `Open app` to open the app

With the staging app, if you would like to move the app to production, click the two up and down arrows and select `Move to production`

And now your application is setup and in production mode!

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration uses Github action to run rspec integration and feature tests that were created in the test driven development process.

Continuous Development is setup through Heroku which has been linked to our github repositories. Our Review application uses our test branch and our main branch hosts our final production application.

## Support

The support of this app has been officially closed as the support team has been reassigned to other projects. No major features remain for development and any bugs are no longer responsibility of the dev team.

## Extra Helps
